# HELIUM GODS!
a [Noble Fates](https://noblefates.com) mod to make the gods' voices silly

## What it does
It turns out the pitch for Kiern and Demonier's voices are just a number you
can edit. So I made them both sound like they've been inhaling helium.

You're welcome.

## How to use it
Put this directory into your `Mods` folder:

`C:\Users\<your name>\AppData\Xobermon, LLC\Noble Fates\Mods`

If you don't have a `Mods` folder, add it, and put this folder in there

If you're seeing this on GitHub, then to download this folder click the little
green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP", then unzip it into your `Mods`
folder.
